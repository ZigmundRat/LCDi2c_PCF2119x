Workflow
========

I don't like Arduino IDE. I love QtCreator, so this repo includes some project files
to work with QtCreator and Makefiles to compiling examples inside QtCreator. To do this,
you must install arduino-mk package on your development box.
See http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/compiling-arduino-sketches-using-makefile
See https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile

You can always use the Arduino IDE if you want.

TODO
====
All funcionality of BT21605 implemented. It's posible other LCD have additional
funcionality but I can't test it.
